# **Expense Equilibrium: A Transaction Management System**

## **Overview**

**Expense Equilibrium** is a transaction management system designed to simplify and optimize the process of managing financial transactions among participants. Developed as part of our college coursework, this project focuses on minimizing cash flow and providing a clear history of transactions. The system allows users to:

- **Record Transactions**: Easily input and manage financial exchanges.
- **Visualize Debts**: Get an overview of who owes what to whom.
- **Detect Cycles**: Identify and resolve any circular debt issues within the transaction graph.

With a user-friendly interface and efficient algorithms, **Expense Equilibrium** ensures a streamlined experience for managing expenses among participants.

## **Features**

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation.
- **Transaction History**: Clear display of past transactions for easy tracking.
- **Cash Flow Minimization**: Automatically optimizes payments to reduce the overall cash flow.

## **Technologies Used**

- **C Programming Language**
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Arrays, and Linked Lists
- **Dynamic Memory Management**
